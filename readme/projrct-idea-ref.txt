abstract
	The Web Server Management System  is a centralized, web-based platform designed to monitor, manage, and secure multiple web servers in real time. 
The system follows a distributed agent-based architecture, where a lightweight monitoring agent is installed on each target server to collect system metrics and traffic data. 
These agents securely communicate with a centralized backend server built using Spring Boot,
while a React-based dashboard provides real-time visualization and administrative control.
