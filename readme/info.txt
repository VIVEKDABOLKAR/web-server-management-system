1. Project Title

Web Server Management System

2. Project Overview

A Web Server Management System (WSMS) is a centralized web-based application designed to monitor, configure, control, and maintain web servers efficiently.
It provides administrators with a single dashboard to manage multiple servers, monitor performance, handle deployments, control services, manage users, and ensure security.

Traditionally, server management requires manual command-line operations and constant supervision, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to simplify server administration through automation, real-time monitoring, and an intuitive web interface.

3. Problem Statement

Managing web servers manually presents several challenges:

Lack of centralized control for multiple servers

Difficulty in real-time performance monitoring

High risk of human error during configuration

Limited visibility into server health and resource usage

Delayed response to server failures or security threats

Small organizations and educational institutions often lack advanced tools, leading to downtime, performance issues, and security risks.

This project addresses these issues by providing a unified, automated, and user-friendly web server management solution.

4. Objectives

To design a centralized web interface for server management

To provide real-time monitoring of server resources

To automate common server administration tasks

To improve server reliability and security

To reduce manual effort and operational errors
