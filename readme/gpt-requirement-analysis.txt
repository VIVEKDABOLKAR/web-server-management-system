Phase-1 Requirement Analysis
Web Server Management System (MVP)

Phase-1 Goal:
Enable admin authentication, server onboarding, basic server monitoring (CPU & memory), basic traffic visualization, and minimal control actions.

1. Admin Signup
For Signup

Registration Form

Mandatory fields

Email

Username

Password

Optional fields

Full name

Validate user inputs

Valid email format

Unique username

Password complexity (min length, special character)

Prevent duplicate username and email

If duplicate found, show error message

Store admin credentials in database

Email

Username

Hashed password

Send verification email to admin

Mark admin as verified after successful verification

Redirect admin to login page

2. Admin Login
For Login

Login Form

Email / Username

Password

Validate credentials

Check user exists

Verify password hash

Check verification status

If not verified, deny access

Generate authentication token/session

Redirect to admin dashboard

3. Admin Dashboard (Basic)
For Dashboard Initialization

Load dashboard after successful login

Display summary cards

Total servers

Active servers

Blocked IP count

Establish WebSocket connection

For real-time updates

4. Add Server (Server Onboarding)
For Adding a Server

Add Server Form

Server name

Server IP address

Server type (Linux / Windows)

Description (optional)

Validate server inputs

Valid IP address format

Prevent duplicate server IP

Generate unique server ID

Store server details in database

Server ID

Server name

IP address

Status (Inactive by default)

Display server in dashboard with “Inactive” status

5. Install Monitoring Agent on Server
For Agent Installation

Generate agent installation command/script

Includes server ID and auth token

Display installation steps on dashboard

Download agent

Run install command

Agent registers with backend

Sends server ID

Authenticates using token

Backend validates server registration

Mark server as “Active” once agent is connected

6. Server Health Monitoring (CPU & Memory)
For Server Metrics Collection

Agent collects system metrics

CPU usage percentage

Memory usage percentage

Agent sends metrics at fixed intervals

Example: every 5 seconds

Backend receives and processes metrics

Store latest metrics in memory (cache)

For Server Metrics Visualization

Display CPU usage as speedometer/gauge

Real-time value

Color indicators (Normal / High / Critical)

Display memory usage as speedometer/gauge

Auto-refresh values using WebSocket updates

7. Server Details Page
For Server Detail View

Click on server from dashboard

Display server information

Server name

IP address

Status (Active / Inactive)

Last heartbeat time

Display live CPU and memory gauges

8. Traffic & Request Analytics (Basic)
For Traffic Collection

Agent collects request count

Total requests

Requests per second (RPS)

Agent sends traffic data to backend

Backend processes traffic metrics

For Traffic Visualization

Display line graph for requests per second

Display total requests count

Support time filters

Last 1 hour

Last 24 hours

9. User / IP Tracking (Basic)
For IP Tracking

Capture incoming request IP address

Track request count per IP

Store IP activity data

IP address

Request count

Last request time

10. IP Block / Unblock (Manual)
For Blocking IP

Display list of IP addresses with request counts

Admin selects IP to block

Confirm block action

Store blocked IP in database

Agent receives updated block list

Agent rejects requests from blocked IP

For Unblocking IP

Admin selects blocked IP

Confirm unblock action

Remove IP from blocked list

Agent updates firewall/filter rules

11. Basic Alerts (Threshold-Based)
For Alerts

Define default thresholds

CPU usage > 80%

Memory usage > 80%

RPS > limit

Backend checks metrics against thresholds

If threshold exceeded

Mark alert status on dashboard

12. Logout
For Logout

Admin clicks logout

Invalidate session/token

Redirect to login page

Phase-1 Deliverables Summary

✔ Signup & Login
✔ Admin Dashboard
✔ Add Server
✔ Agent Installation
✔ CPU & Memory Monitoring (Speedometer)
✔ Basic Traffic Graph
✔ Manual IP Blocking
✔ Real-time updates

If you want next, I can:

Split this into backend vs frontend tasks

Create database schema for Phase-1

Design API endpoints

Help you decide what NOT to build in Phase-1 (very important for scoring well)
